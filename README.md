First-Person Shooter Game in Panda3D
This project is a basic First-Person Shooter (FPS) game developed using the Panda3D game engine. It provides an interactive 3D environment where players can move around using WASD keys, look around with the mouse, and simulate shooting mechanics using raycasting.

Features
WASD Movement: Navigate forward, backward, and strafe.
Mouse Look: Look around in all directions using the mouse.
Shooting Mechanic: Simulate shooting with raycasting, and detect collisions with objects in the environment.
Crosshair: A simple red sphere as a placeholder crosshair.
Customizable Camera: Adjustable mouse sensitivity and movement speed.
Requirements
To run this game, ensure the following prerequisites are installed:

Python 3.7+
The game is compatible with Python 3.7 or later.

Dependencies
Install the required Python modules:

bash
Copy code
pip install panda3d
pip install pillow  # Optional for texture handling
pip install numpy   # Optional for advanced mathematical operations
3D Models
The code expects a sample environment model (models/environment.egg) and a sphere model (models/misc/sphere.egg). These models can be downloaded from the Panda3D sample assets.

Installation
Clone the repository or copy the script into your local directory.
Ensure the necessary models (environment.egg and sphere.egg) are in the models/ directory.
Install dependencies using pip as listed above.
How to Run
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python fps_game.py
Controls
Movement:
W: Move forward
S: Move backward
A: Strafe left
D: Strafe right
Look Around: Move the mouse.
Shoot: Left mouse button (Mouse1).
Exit: Press Esc.
Customization
Mouse Sensitivity: Modify the self.mouse_sensitivity variable in the code to adjust how quickly the player looks around.
Movement Speed: Change the speed value in the process_movement method to adjust player movement speed.
Environment: Replace the models/environment.egg file with any other compatible 3D model to use a different environment.
Future Enhancements
This code serves as a starting point for an FPS game. You can expand it by:

Adding enemies with AI behavior.
Implementing health, ammo, and other gameplay mechanics.
Enhancing visuals with shaders, textures, and animations.
Including sound effects for shooting and collisions.
